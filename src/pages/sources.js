    Every 10 XP you gain, you gain a Proficiency you must spend to gain one benefit on a Gift you currently possess. You may only gain a benefit if you have the required number of Gifts listed as a pre-requirement on the benefit. example: [2 G] would require possessing 2 gifts. (To prevent strong benefits being on low progression characters). After your 5th Gift the required XP points increases to 15.
