    Your Source is the origin of your Powers. Its what separates you from the common people and gives you the strength to go on your adventures. As you <a href="rules/leveling">Level Up</a> you'll gain <a href="powers">Powers</a> which grant you super human Powers to elevate you above mortal capabilities.
    <br/>
    Every 5 XP you gain, you gain a Proficiency you must spend to gain one benefit on a Power you currently possess. You may only gain a benefit if you are in or above the level tier pre-requirement on the benefit. example: [Epic] would require being at least level 4. (To prevent strong benefits being on low progression characters).

    Below is a list of links to the main page for each Source. On it will be a description of the Source, the resource system for using that Source's Powers, the proficiencies that any character with that Source may acquire, the Lesser Powers you may gain from that Source, and the capstone you may choose when you reach level 8.
