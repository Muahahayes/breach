    Your Source is the origin of your Powers. Its what separates you from the common people and gives you the strength to go on your adventures. As you <a href="rules/leveling">Level Up</a> you'll gain <a href="powers">Powers</a> which grant you super human Powers to elevate you above mortal capabilities.
    <br/>
    Every 5 XP you gain, you gain a Proficiency you must spend to gain one benefit on a Power you currently possess. You may only gain a benefit if you have the required number of Powers listed as a pre-requirement on the benefit. example: [LVL 2] would require possessing 2 powers. (To prevent strong benefits being on low progression characters). After your 5th Power the required XP points increases to 10.
