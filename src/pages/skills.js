    `Increases the result of d20 rolls which attempt to accomplish some task. All Skills start at 0 and are increased by the starting points given by your Race and when you Hard Succeed (passing a Skill check by rolling and adding your bonuses to result in an amount which is 5 or more above the difficulty of the check). 
    When you roll to attempt to use a Skill, if you roll a Soft Success you accomplish your task with some kind of minor drawbacks or less effective result. If you roll a Soft Fail you do not accomplish your task. If you Hard Succeed you accomplish the task with no drawbacks. If you Hard Fail you do not accomplish the task and have a meaningful drawback or consequence.
    Try to use Skill checks as a story telling moment. On a Hard Success, let the player tell you what happens next (within the scope of that one action's consequences). On a Soft Success, the GM tells what happens next (while keeping a neutral or positive overall outcome). On a Soft Fail, let the player tell you what happens next (while keeping a neutral or negative overall outcome). On a Hard Fail the GM tells what happens next (with possible extra penalties/consequences). 
    
    Limits:
    The maximum points you may have in a Skill is 5x the number of Gifts you possess. If a Skill is at its maximum it cannot gain XP from a Hard Succeed.
    
    Inspiring Expertise:
    If a member of your party is a Gift level above you, their expertise inspires you and you now gain XP any successful roll. This effect only applies when you roll one of their 5 highest Skills and you are within 100 ft.
