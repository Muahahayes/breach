  slogan: "The Powers of the Aether",
  description: "Cosmics are an educated sect of mystics, who seek to understand the universe. They use rigorous metaphysics theory, called Aethology, to study and define the way magic interacts with the world. While Psychics intuitively resonate their inner Aether with their surroundings; Cosmics use meditation to draw Aether inside themselves, manipulate and change it through studied practice, and release it back into the world to spread those changes. In modern society if you do not have Psychic talents, joining Cosmic academia is another established path into the upper class.",
  resource: "Cosmic Well: You gain a Well of Aether (ae) within your soul. Your Well can hold up to [5 + G + Will] ae at one time. You gain [5 + G] ae from a Full Sleep, and an amount equal to [G + Will] when you take a Break. If you reach 0 ae you will be rendered unconscious and you will regain 1 ae if you are woken up, or 5 if you fully sleep.\nElemental Soul: Choose an elemental, Spirit, or Darkness damage type. Your Well is attuned to this element. Add G damage to any damage you deal with this element. You are resistant to this damage type.",
