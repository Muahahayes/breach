  slogan: "The Powers of the Aether",
  description: "Cosmics are an educated sect of mystics, who seek to understand the universe. They use rigorous metaphysics theory, called Aethology, to study and define the way magic interacts with the world. While Psychics intuitively resonate their inner Aether with their surroundings; Cosmics use meditation to draw Aether inside themselves, manipulate and change it through studied practice, and release it back into the world to spread those changes. In modern society if you do not have Psychic talents, joining Cosmic academia is another established path into the upper class.",
