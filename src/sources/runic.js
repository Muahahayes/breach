  resource: "Engravings: When you level up, instead of selecting 1 Gift you may select 3 (these Gifts collectively count as 1 towards your G). You Engrave that Gift into your body to attune yourself to its power. You may only use a Gift if that Gift's Engraving is awakened. After a Full Sleep all of your currently awakened Engravings become suppressed and then you may select up to G Engravings, these Engraving awaken with Aether and glow brightly on your skin. After a Break you may awaken 1 Engraving by suppressing a different Engraving which is currently awakened. When you gain a Proficiency you may only apply it to a currently awakened Engraving, you may only use Proficiencies that are on currently awakened Engravings.\nFading: Whenever you use an Engraving it will gain a point of Fade. Each point of Fade reduces all d20 rolls done with that Engraving by 1 up to a maximum of 20. All Fades are removed when you finish a Full Sleep.",
