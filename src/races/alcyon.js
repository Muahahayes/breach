  name:"Alcyon",
  description:`Those who were considered the giants of Human folklore would have, at one time, loved nothing more than to remain hidden on their islands, ignored by the progressing world around them. The story of their name (Alcyons) was discovered by Humans once they learned of their plentiful, varied, and often contradictory stories of complicated parentage, passed down orally in the Alcyon's tight-knit yet large family dens. Alcyons believe themselves to be the children of their beloved Anesidora (mother of gifts) and the respected-but-lost Ouranos (father of the cosmos). These figures are still revered to these ancient people, even as the giants have slowly ingratiated themselves into the most industrious labor force Humanity could have ever hoped for. Culturally, male Alcyons are voluntarily celibate while the females follow the example of Anesidora and bestow their affections as gifts of the Earth to them, usually in the form of fruits, vegetables, and land "ownership" (as the Humans call it). According to the Alcyon, and generally refuted as biologically impossible by other races, is the idea that the males of the species have no part in the creation of offspring. The Alcyons maintain that females will naturally bless them with a family when it is willed, which the males will then protect and provide for by being the intermediary of their own exchanging of gifts to outsider cultures; Alcyons rely almost entirely on a blind-faith reciprical nature of this exchange, which is often abused. A male Alcyon who is never blessed with a family, forsakes celibacy, and rejects Anesidoric gifts are not cast-out from their tribe, but are rather seen as children of Ouranos and expected to live a solitary life of exploring the cosmos to find their lost Father; Ouranos, the fabled sole-patriarch of their entire shared lineage.`,
