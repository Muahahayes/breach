They hail from the tropical continent of Etzal to the south, where the two species contend for dominance in a never ending feud. In recent times they've brokered an uneasy peace to end physical hostilities, but they compete fiercely in all matters of culture, trade, and diplomacy on the global stage.`, 
  appearance:`The common traits between the two Atal races are their serpent-like bodies and cold-blooded metabolism. They have hunched shoulders and are as comfortable running on four legs or two. Although they share a language, each has a dialect which gives its own flavor.`,
