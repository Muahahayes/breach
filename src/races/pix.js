  name:"Pix",
  description:`The Pix are a small race of the old world. They are known as great craftsmen of intricate designs and mechanics, making use of their Flourish ability to manipulate the cogs or wires of devices they work on without the need for precision tools. Due to their small size, when they interact with an object too large for their hands or feet they will instinctively use Floursih as an extension of their limb. They are playful, and tend to pull pranks on the larger races, but their word is their bond and if money or favors change hands they will deliver the product or service as promised. Because of this, they don't usually do well in politics and are often overlooked by authority figures. Due to their lighthearted nature, short sighted spending habits, and non-confrontational attitudes many Pix find themselves in contract service in various forms, which lead to generational contracts of Pix families fulfilling the duties promised by their ancestors. Many noble houses have a family of Pix serving their estate, fulfilling the duties of accountant, butler, cook and caretakers. Often they are treated well, as they are not considered slaves but are merely fulfilling an old family contract which in some ways the Pix may value more than the nobles, with some of the younger children leaving the home to find schooling or a profession in the world so long as enough family members remain to continue their family obligation to the house.`, 
  appearance:`They have pointed features and colorful skin of 1-3 gradient hues of pastel tones. They have 4 small thin wings sprouting from their backside which buzz quickly to lift them into the air. They rarely grow facial hair, or any hair at all below their eyebrows. The women tend to be smaller in the bust and even the men are often considered 'cute' in the face which can cause those unfamiliar with the Pix to have trouble telling the difference between the sexes.`,

  racials:[
    "Frail: -1 Max Life.",
    "Evasive: +1 Avoidance vs Physical or Elemental attacks.",
    "Clever: Add 1 to your Will Saving rolls.",
		"Flourish: Pix can pull objects within 5ft towards them with a wave of their hand, and by gripping the empty air they can psychically grip/manipulate and hold objects within 1ft of that hand. Only usable on objects that weigh no more than 20 pounds plus five times their Strength (if it is positive). Requires use of their hand. Weapons and Tools longer than 1ft can only be held using this method, enabling them to use objects that larger races can use by default. Gain a Favored +1 for sleight of hand or other object manipulation tricks.",
 		"Flight: The Pix can Fly, allowing them to freely move in 3 dimensions. While flying, add a 1d4 to your Movement Distance. However, Pix are not very strong at flying and cannot fly very high. After every turn, or 10min of flight, you must be within 5ft above a surface. If you are more than 5ft above a surface roll a d20 + Stamina vs 10 to stay airborne, on a fail you fall until landing on a solid surface. Ignore difficult terrain while traveling. The buzzing gives an Unfavored -1 to Sneak and Hide rolls while flying. If you are missing a wing subtract 2 from their Speed while flying and subtract 1 from their roll to stay high in the air. If they are missing 2 wings subtract 4 and 2 respectively. If they are missing more than 2 wings they cannot Fly."
