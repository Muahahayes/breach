  description:`The Aeth are a wandering race that came through a Breach over 100 years ago. Their home world was destroyed a millenia ago and they have moved from world to world ever since. The Aeth are a proud race of scholars and artists, continually seeking higher knowledge and accomplishment. Young Aeth often apprentice under an elder to learn from them and perfect a profession or subject of study. Although they age quicker than Humans, reaching maturity at the age of 10, they do not consider this Adulthood. All Aeth are nameless at birth and called 'Child', 'Young-One', or perhaps referred to as the apprentice of their mentor. When an Aeth does something meaningful and worth acknowledgement by their elders they are given a name in recognition which they wear with honor as a sign of Adulthood. Referring to an Adult Aeth with a pronoun or anything other than their name is seen as a sign of disrespect.`, 
  appearance:`They have a light blue skin and are incredibly thin. Their features are characteristically slender and long. Their face's are tall and thin, and the men exaggerate this further with long wispy beards. Their feet are long and high arched, favoring their weight on their toes instead of their heels which gives their footwear a distinctly high heeled style.`,
