  name: "Darkin",
  description:"Humans found that as their increasing frequency and depth of drilling for materials pushed deeper into the unexplored depths of the earth, there arose a great clamor of distress from those who already inhabited the darkest recesses of the warm mantle. These Darkin posess surprisingly human-like yet diminutive figures which have made it a constant struggle to ever be truly accepted by their surface-dwelling brethren. When first being introduced to broader society, they were initially widely considered to resemble goblins by the superstitious, but it is now considered to be a slur to most--yet remains a surprising badge of honor to the particularly anti-social. Most surprising of all was that, despite their disconnect from the progress of the world around them, the Darkin were quite technologically advanced, utilizing the ore and thermodynamics of The Under, their massive and sprawling compartmentalized society connected by their revered electromagnetic tunnels, to fuel their scientific advancement. While they are familiar with many of the infrastructure advancements known to the Humans (having almost singlehandedly restructured their electrical grid to remove Humans from their dependencies on unrenewable fuel sources), the Darkin are still new to the surface world and have much to learn if they hope to fit in. In modern times, they champion electrical engineering innovations to stand out and help legitamize themselves amongst the races.",
  appearance:"Their earthy skin tones range from an ashy gray to an iron-deposit red. Generally thin and gangly in build, their shoulders often hunched slightly as an adaptation to their cramped living spaces. Darkin generally posess sharp, not necessarily ugly, facial features and light-toned eye colors from pastel blue to near neon yellow. Whether these unusual eye colors are due to a lack of consistant light or a random mutation is still uncertain. They are similar enough to be compared in appearance to goblins from Human folk-lore, but they consider that name to be a highly offensive slur.",
