    Select one single sentence or phrase for each of the 5 Quirks below. Try to select 5 Quirks which do not paint the same picture at first glance, more variety leads to a more fleshed out character and more situations where a Quirk can come into play! <br/>
    If a Quirk would probably apply to Â¼ or more combat encounters during the campaign, reword or replace the Quirk (ie. Role: Master Black Belt, the player may ask for a bonus to any melee fight they encounter, try something like Wise Monk and emphasize the philosophy of martial arts more than just the combat ability). <br/>
    Whenever a Quirk would reasonably give you more experience or aptitude in a situation, apply a Favored +1 to your rolls. If a Quirk would reasonably increase the difficulty of a situation, apply an Unfavored -1 to your rolls but you're awarded 3 xp instead of 1 for any Hard Success that would award xp and 1 xp for any other result. You cannot apply more than 1 Quirk to a single roll.<br/>
