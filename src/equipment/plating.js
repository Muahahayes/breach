    A Projection Plating unit projects a layer of Hard Light across your body, protecting you from harm. When it is active, it provides you with an amount of Shielding and 
    may also increase your Avoidance. When the Shielding runs out, the unit fails and no longer is active. The unit recharges and comes back on after taking a Break or a Full Sleep. 
    Units are strapped onto your body and can weigh a considerable amount, you can only equip a unit if you meet the required Strength.
