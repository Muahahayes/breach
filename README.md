# Breach Player Guidebook

Breach is a new Tabletop RPG system I've been working on since October 2019. I've decided instead of making a traditional PDF book, I'll use this as an opportunity to learn React.js and making an app-like book for players to reference the rules and content of the game. The webpage is currently hosted on Heroku while I'm working on building it. http://breach-playerguide.herokuapp.com/

Breach came from a desire to have more choices at each level up, and less railroading in how a class develops each level. There's a focus on using Skills in and out of combat, and the primary source of XP (the method of leveling up) comes from using Skills. I'm currently in school and have begun taking Senior classes in my Computer Science degree so progress will be slow on this project, but I'm commited to seeing it through to at least getting it in a playable state. After getting it to a playable Beta I will playtest it with my own social groups, and if the response is favorable and the core systems are viable I will iterate on their feedback and push forward. At that point I plan on refactoring the app to do better 'React Style' coding, as currently I'm learning React from scratch and leaning heavily on my previous JS skills so the code looks more spaghetti than I'd like. After that I'll apply some form of CSS framework to the app to improve its appearance, as the function of the app and the RPG system itself takes priority over appearance while in an Alpha state.

If you want to playtest the game with friends go ahead! If you have any notes for me, good or bad, you can email me at muahahayes@gmail.com to give me feedback. Please include Breach in the subject of the email.


## React readme stuff below:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
